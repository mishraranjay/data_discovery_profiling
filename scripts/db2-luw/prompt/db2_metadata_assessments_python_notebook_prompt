Prompt for Code Generation
Objective: Create a Python script to execute SQL files against a DB2 database and save the results as CSV files.

Requirements:

1. Imports and Setup:

Import necessary libraries: os, pandas, and ibm_db.
Ensure pandas displays all columns and adjusts column width for better readability.

2. Database Connection:

Define a connection string for a DB2 database with placeholders for hostname and password.
Use ibm_db to establish a connection to the database.

3. Directory Paths:

Define input and output directories for SQL files and result CSVs.
input  = /Volumes/workspace/default/sql
ouput = /Volumes/workspace/default/output

4. SQL Execution:

Iterate over all .sql files in the specified directory.
For each file:
Read the SQL query.
Execute the query using ibm_db.
Fetch results and store them in a pandas DataFrame.
Save the DataFrame to a CSV file in the output directory.

5. Error Handling:

Implement try-except blocks to handle and log any errors during SQL execution.

6. Connection Closure:

Ensure the database connection is closed after processing all files.
